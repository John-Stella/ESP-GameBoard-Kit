🧱 Case Design Versions
Throughout the development of the game board enclosure, multiple iterations were made to address size, accessibility, and structural integrity concerns. Below is a breakdown of each version stored in the Case/ folder:

📁 Case V1 — Initial Design
Display: Designed for the original 10.1-inch display.

Structure: Bulky form factor with oversized standoffs, raising concerns about mechanical integrity.

Issues:

Large standoffs susceptible to shearing if misaligned.

Non-detachable bottom hindered internal access — a key project requirement.

Summary: Served as an early prototype but was quickly deemed impractical.

📁 Case V2 — Improved 10.1-Inch Revision
Enhancements:

Introduced ledges to support smaller standoffs, improving print stability and structural strength.

Added a detachable bottom for full internal access.

Print Challenges:

Precision requirements exceeded printer capability, causing brittle and misaligned prints.

Enclosure was split into four parts using a peg-and-hole system to fit within build plate limits.

Issues:

Peg-and-hole joints introduced new shearing risks.

Ultimately abandoned due to display driver problems.

📁 Final Case V — Redesigned for 7-Inch Display
Display: Reworked entirely for a more compact 7-inch display included with the ESP32 kit.

Design Improvements:

Replaced fragile standoffs with robust corner supports and integrated metal standoffs on the display.

Added port cutouts for power switch and charging access.

Result: Achieved a sleek, durable enclosure aligned with project goals.

Each version is available as .STL and .STEP files in its respective subfolder. You can view these in most 3D modeling software or slice them for printing using Cura, PrusaSlicer, or equivalent tools.
